# Introduction to Product List Sorting (PLS)
### Level: Beginner 
### Presentation: [Introduction to Product List Sorting](workshop/Presentation_PLS_Intro.pdf)

## Workshop description
 During the workshop you will learn how to train a machine learning model in Python to sort products into a list that maximizes the click-through rate (CTR). This process solves one of the classic problems in e-commerce: the virtual presentation of products, especially their order, which varies along the customer journey.


## Requirements
+ Python 3.8
+ conda
+ Kaggle API token. Usage instructions:

To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of kaggle.json, a file containing your API credentials. Place this file in the location ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json. On Windows in the location C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json.
[Documentation here](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)


## Usage
* Clone the repository
* Create the virtual environment
```
$ cd product-sorting-beginner-sep2021
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

* Open the notebook in VCS with the kernel
